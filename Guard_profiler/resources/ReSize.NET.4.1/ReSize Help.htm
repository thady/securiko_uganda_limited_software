<I>ReSize .NET Custom Control<br>By Larcom and Young</I></center>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
</h1> 

<p>ReSize .NET is based on the popular ReSize control that was first released in 1995.  Since that time tens of thousands of developers have used ReSize  to enhance the appearance and usability of their applications.</p>

<p>ReSize is a.NET component (invisible at runtime) that gives your applications resolution independence. ReSize alters the sizes, font sizes and positions of controls on Windows Forms as they are sized.  Applications can run at 800x600 on one computer and 1280x1024 on another yet still look good on both machines.  Controls remain proportional in size to the forms that contain them.  You don't need to write any code or set the properties of individual controls, simply place the ReSize control on your form.</p>
